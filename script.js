// My Java was working, as far as I could take these, in repl.it. But the actual file would not bring up a browser and I double and triple checked my link to html.
// Exercise 2 Got stuck in the continuous loop -- it wouldn't continue asking.
// Exercise 3 Could not figure out how to repeat the question after the initial follow-up. Or have the exclaimation point keep expanding.
// Exercise 4 seems to work! Just not as a repeat pop-up.


// EXERCISE 1

//var name = prompt("Enter a number!");

//var total = 0;
//for (var i = 1; i <= name; i++) {
//total = total + i;
//}
//console.log(total);

//EXERCISE 2

//var name = prompt("Enter a number!");

//var total = 0;
//for (var i = 1; i <= name; i++) {
//total = total + i;
//}
//console.log(total);


//EXERCISE 3

//var question;
//var repeat
//var x=1;

 //question = prompt("Would you like to print your name?")
//while (question !== "yes");
//console.log("Hello. My name is Adam");

//if (repeat == "yes");
 //repeat = prompt("Would you like to print your name again?");

//var output = "Hello. My name is Adam"
//{
//output = output+"!";
//console.log(output)
//}
//x++;

//EXERCISE 4

var menu = prompt("What time of day is it? Morning, noon or night?")

if (menu === "Morning")
  console.log("Since it's morning, breakfast is the best option. We recommend coffee and an English Muffin.");

  else if  (menu === "noon")
  console.log("Since it's midday, lunch is the best option. We recommend a sandwich.");

  else if (menu === "night")
  console.log("Since it's night, dinner is the best option. We recommend something off the grill.");
